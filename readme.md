### Hi there, I'm Ste!

I'm a fullstack JS developer from Leeds, UK. I currently work at @typeform during the day, but founded @littleboatdigital to help small businesses get a premium online presence.


I'm currently rebuilding www.steoneill.dev, and starting to write a book about using Prismic and Next.js!
